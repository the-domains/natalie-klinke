# Going to live as digital Normad

After a lot of changes and thoughts, i decided that i will change my work-live balance and way of working. Since i was little i dream about traveling. But as a young mother, i didn't have the money, i didn't have the possibility. Even if live was tough as young mother, i have made it. Now after 12 years of freelancing as frontenddeveloper and  specialized in TYPO3, managing a lot of projects i ask my self how live should go on.

I love my job and everything around. Working in opensource groups and topics match my personal views. People are open minded and always solution-oriented. How much more experience will it be, if you get in contact with international people? 

2016 is the year to explore this thought. So i send a high-five to all digital nomads who already has made it and i look forward to meet you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7cf8313f-27d4-42ca-a862-f43b4a59b396.jpg)
